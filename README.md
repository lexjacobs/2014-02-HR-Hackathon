====================

2014-02 36 hour Hack Reactor hackathon

data source:
http://bayareabikeshare.com/datachallenge
http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/stations/json

minimum viable concept:
Have an animated dot represent the movement of a single day of bike trips.

Rendering tech:
http://d3js.org/

Planned iterations, as time allows:
  * Add representative markers for the bike stations.
  * Change the dot to a bicycle graphic.
  * Superimpose the trips upon a googleMap via the public api.
  * Increment a counter through the 24 hours of the day and spawn the bike trips of that hour
  * Serve pages via Node Express
